# Real-Time Object Detection and Classification

## 1. Dataset Preparation
- Use a popular object detection dataset like COCO or Pascal VOC.
- Preprocess the dataset to suit the chosen model architecture (e.g., resizing images, normalizing pixel values).

## 2. Model Training with PyTorch
- Select a suitable object detection model (e.g., Faster R-CNN, YOLO, or SSD).
- Implement the model using PyTorch.
- Train the model on the dataset, ensuring to include data augmentation and regularization techniques.

## 3. Model Optimization with ONNX
- Convert the trained PyTorch model to ONNX format.
- Optimize the ONNX model using ONNX Runtime for better performance.
- Test the optimized model for accuracy and performance benchmarks.

## 4. Inference with DirectML
- Integrate the optimized ONNX model into a real-time application using DirectML.
- Implement the inference pipeline to process video streams or live camera feeds.
- Use DirectML to leverage GPU acceleration for faster inference.

## 5. Real-Time Application
- Develop a user interface to display the real-time object detection results.
- Include functionalities such as bounding box visualization, confidence scores, and object labels.
- Ensure the application runs efficiently on various hardware configurations.

## 6. Documentation and Deployment
- Document the entire process, including code comments, explanations, and usage instructions.
- Create a detailed README file for the GitHub repository.
- Include sample videos and screenshots showcasing the real-time object detection system.
- Provide instructions for setting up the environment, dependencies, and running the application.
